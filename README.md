# Leviathan Framework (Public-Safe Overview)

A modular, extensible security automation and intelligent analysis framework. It orchestrates multi-phase software and binary analysis: discovery, detection, fuzzing, ML-assisted pattern evolution, exploitation pipeline simulation, validation, and structured reporting. It emphasizes adaptive intelligence (pattern evolution + ML inference), and production-grade orchestration primitives (async IO, caching, connection pooling, distributed runners).

## Key Capabilities (Public-Safe Summary)

- Modular pipeline: Discovery → Detection → Coverage & Fuzzing → Analysis → (Simulated) Exploitation → Reporting & Validation.
- Adaptive ML integration for pattern evolution and zero-day hypothesis generation (pluggable models).
- Differential & edge-guided fuzzing with semantic eBPF modeling hooks.
- Structured orchestration: async execution, caching, connection pools, model lifecycle management.
- Advanced analysis: race condition scanning, speculative execution surfaces, post-quantum considerations (conceptual analyzers).
- Extensible CLI for automation, research, deployment, dashboards, and server/control routines.
- Clean extension points for adding:
  - New detection engines
  - Fuzzing strategies
  - Coverage heuristics
  - ML inference providers
  - Exploit simulation modules
  - Reporting backends
