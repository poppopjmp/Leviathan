# Leviathan Framework (Public-Safe Overview)

A modular, extensible security automation and intelligent analysis framework. It orchestrates multi-phase software and binary analysis: discovery, detection, fuzzing, ML-assisted pattern evolution, exploitation pipeline simulation, validation, and structured reporting. It emphasizes adaptive intelligence (pattern evolution + ML inference), and production-grade orchestration primitives (async IO, caching, connection pooling, distributed runners).

---
## Key Capabilities (Public-Safe Summary)

- Modular pipeline: Discovery → Detection → Coverage & Fuzzing → Analysis → (Simulated) Exploitation → Reporting & Validation.
- Adaptive ML integration for pattern evolution and zero-day hypothesis generation (pluggable models).
- Differential & edge-guided fuzzing with semantic eBPF modeling hooks.
- Structured orchestration: async execution, caching, connection pools, model lifecycle management.
- Advanced analysis: race condition scanning, speculative execution surfaces, post-quantum considerations (conceptual analyzers).
- Extensible CLI for automation, research, deployment, dashboards, and server/control routines.
- Clean extension points for adding:
  - New detection engines
  - Fuzzing strategies
  - Coverage heuristics
  - ML inference providers
  - Exploit simulation modules
  - Reporting backends

## Core Subsystems

### 1. Orchestration & Core (`core/`, `production_orchestrator.py`)
- `framework.py`: Central registration + pipeline assembly.
- Optimized layers:
  - `optimized_async_io.py`: Structured concurrency primitives.
  - `optimized_cache_manager.py`: Result/resource caching abstraction.
  - `optimized_connection_pools.py`: Managed external resource pooling (e.g., engines, services).
  - `optimized_model_manager.py`: Lifecycle + allocation of ML models.
  - `optimized_production_orchestrator.py`: Production-strength coordination wrapper.
- `config.py`: Central configuration definitions (ingest from env/file).
  
### 2. CLI (`cli/`)
- `main.py`: Entry point (likely `python -m framework.cli` pattern).
- Command groups: automation, dashboard, deployment, enhanced ops, research, server controls.
- Helpers: shared formatting, safety guards, context loaders.

### 3. Discovery & Detection
- `discovery/engine.py`: Enumerates targets / inputs / components.
- `detection/engine.py` + `enhanced_bug_class_analyzer.py`: Classifies potential issues (modular analyzers).
- Separation enables substituting static/dynamic detection strategies.

### 4. Coverage & Fuzzing (`coverage/`, `fuzzing/`)
- Coverage correlation: `coverage_analyzer.py` + `enhanced_bug_patterns.py`.
- Fuzzing strategies: edge-guided, differential, manager vs. simple manager.
- Semantics models: `ebpf_semantics.py`, `ebpf_semantics_simple.py` for structured fuzzing control.
- Memory safety oracle (`memory_safety_oracle.py`) for triage + prioritization.

### 5. ML & Adaptive Intelligence (`ml/`)
- `model_manager.py`, `inference_engine.py` orchestrate inference.
- Evolution engines: `enhanced_pattern_evolution.py`, `enhanced_zero_day_discovery.py`.
- Production variants (prefixed with `production_`) focus on scaling and reliability.
- Fallback strategies (`fallback_ml.py`) for graceful degradation.

### 6. Exploitation Simulation (`exploitation/`, `exploits/`, `development/`)
- Controlled exploit generation primitives (non-malicious simulation of exploit class feasibility).
- Real vs. placeholder exploit objects managed by `exploits/manager.py`.
- JIT exploitation concept module (`jit_exploitation.py`) demonstrates adaptive strategy formation.
- Development helpers separate experimental logic from production paths.

### 7. Advanced Analysis (`advanced/`)
- Race condition analyzer, speculative execution analyzer, post-quantum analyzer, exploitation chain analysis.
- `production_ai_engine.py` + `ai_analysis_engine.py`: Composite reasoning engines.
- Framework enhancement validation modules ensure adaptation remains safe and within constraints.

### 8. Distributed / Scaling (`infrastructure/`)
- Distributed analysis strategies + multi-architecture validation module.
- Separation between generic and production-hardened orchestration paths.

### 9. Reporting & Validation
- Reporting modules (folder placeholder) transform results into structured artifacts.
- Validation modules enforce correctness, safety, and enhancement integrity.

## Workflow Summary (Conceptual)

1. Load config → initialize orchestrator.
2. Discovery engine enumerates targets.
3. Detection engine classifies candidate issues; feeds coverage & fuzzing scope.
4. Fuzzing manager runs strategies (edge-guided, differential, semantics-driven).
5. ML evolution engine refines patterns; inference engine scores candidates.
6. (Simulated) exploitation modules evaluate feasibility & chain potential.
7. Coverage + validation confirm novelty / safety.
8. Reporting layer emits structured results.
9. CLI / automation commands coordinate batch or continuous runs.

---
## Quick Start (Example Flow)

Python (library-style):
```python
from framework.core.framework import Framework
# from framework.core.config import load_config  # if available
fw = Framework()  # register defaults
fw.run()          # orchestrates full pipeline (method name may differ)
```

CLI (pattern—adjust to actual command names):
```bash
python -m framework.cli --help
python -m framework.cli run full
python -m framework.cli analyze target --path ./samples
python -m framework.cli fuzz differential --budget 300
```

---
## Configuration

Common sources:
- `core/config.py`: Base schema & defaults.
- `cli/config_advanced.py`: Extended flags / advanced toggles.
- `ct.yaml`: Example pipeline or test configuration template.

Typical configurable domains:
- Target selection
- Fuzzing budgets / mutation strategies
- Model selection & resource caps
- Caching toggles (memory/disk)
- Concurrency limits
- Safety / redaction modes

---
## Performance & Reliability Layers

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Async IO | Concurrency across IO-bound analyzers & model queries |
| Cache Manager | Deduplicates repeated expensive computations |
| Connection Pools | Efficient reuse of external service handles |
| Model Manager | Pre-warms / defers model loading intelligently |
| Distributed Analysis | Scales across architectures or nodes |

Edge Cases Considered:
- Model unavailability → fallback ML
- Partial pipeline failure → degraded but continued reporting
- Duplicate candidate suppression
- Resource exhaustion (timeouts / budget enforcement)
- Cross-architecture divergence (multi-arch validator)

---
## Extensibility Guide

Add a detector:
1. Implement class (e.g., `MyDetector`) with required interface (scan/analyze).
2. Register via a factory or plugin loader in `detection/engine.py`.
3. Expose config keys (thresholds, enable flags).

Add a fuzzing strategy:
1. Create new module under `fuzzing/` (e.g., `novel_strategy.py`).
2. Implement interface used by managers (`Mutator`, `schedule()`, etc.).
3. Register in `manager.py` strategy map.

Integrate a new ML model:
1. Add provider in `ml/models.py` or `lightweight_models.py`.
2. Extend `model_manager.py` to recognize provider key.
3. Optionally add evolution feedback hook.

Add an exploit simulation:
1. Implement under `exploits/` with a clear capability declaration.
2. Register in `exploits/manager.py`.
3. Ensure it respects safety gating & non-harmful output policies.

Reporting backend:
1. Add formatter/exporter module.
2. Hook into reporting aggregation pipeline.

---
## Logging & Monitoring

- Central logger in `core/logger.py` (structured logging advisable).
- Recommended levels: INFO (pipeline progress), DEBUG (component details), WARNING (recoverable anomalies).
- Integrate with monitoring modules for metrics & health signals.

---
## Testing & Validation

Patterns (suggested):
- Unit: per-module logic (detection, fuzz mutators, model wrappers).
- Integration: pipeline dry runs with synthetic targets.
- Validation: enhancement safety checks (`validation/`, `advanced/framework_enhancement_validation.py`).
- Consider property-based tests for fuzz boundary conditions.

---
## Production Considerations

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Non-determinism | Seed control in fuzzing managers |
| Resource spikes | Budget & concurrency caps |
| Model drift | Version pinning in model manager |
| Partial failures | Layered fallback + isolation |
| Scalability | Distributed + async primitives |

---
## Roadmap (Public-Safe Hints)

- Pluggable SBOM / dependency risk ingestion
- Expanded symbolic & taint analysis integration
- Live adaptive reinforcement of fuzz strategies
- Multi-tenant orchestration isolation hardening
